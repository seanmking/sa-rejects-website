## STEP 2: Email System (Two Parts)

### Part A: Email Notifications (Already Configured!)
When someone signs up or uploads a file, you'll automatically receive an email notification at `sean@futuresgroup.co.za` using Cloudflare's FREE MailChannels integration. No setup needed - it just works!

**You'll receive:**
- üî• Email when someone subscribes (with their email address)
- üìé Email when someone uploads a file (with file details)
- Direct link to admin dashboard in each notification

### Part B: Email Forwarding (For receiving emails at @sarejects.co.za)

### In Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to **Email** ‚Üí **Email Routing**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Enter domain: `sarejects.co.za`
4. Cloudflare will add MX records automatically

### Configure Forwarding Rules:
1. **Verify destination email first:**
   - Add `sean@futuresgroup.co.za` as a destination
   - Cloudflare will send a verification email
   - Click the link in that email to verify

2. **Create forwarding rules:**
   - Rule 1: `hello@sarejects.co.za` ‚Üí `sean@futuresgroup.co.za`
   - Rule 2: `admin@sarejects.co.za` ‚Üí `sean@futuresgroup.co.za`
   - Rule 3: `info@sarejects.co.za` ‚Üí `sean@futuresgroup.co.za`
   - OR create catch-all: `*@sarejects.co.za` ‚Üí `sean@futuresgroup.co.za`

### DNS Records Added Automatically:
```
MX    @    1    route1.mx.cloudflare.net
MX    @    2    route2.mx.cloudflare.net
MX    @    3    route3.mx.cloudflare.net
TXT   @         v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net ~all
```

4. Enter: `sarejects.co.za`

   ```
   CNAME    @       sa-rejects-website.pages.dev
   CNAME    www     sa-rejects-website.pages.dev
   ```
2. OR change nameservers to Cloudflare (recommended)
