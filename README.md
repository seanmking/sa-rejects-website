# SA REJECTS Website

## ⚠️ FOR DEVELOPERS ⚠️

This site is deliberately:
- Rough around the edges
- Not perfectly aligned
- Using casual/profane language
- Celebrating imperfection

DO NOT "FIX" THESE THINGS. They're features, not bugs.

If you're about to:
- Clean up the design
- Professional-ize the language  
- Add smooth animations
- Make it "responsive" and "modern"

STOP. Go read the brand guide first.

We're too strong for clean code. Too busy for best practices.
Building anyway.
